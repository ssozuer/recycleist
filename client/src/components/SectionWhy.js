                        We need to drastically improve our recycling habits â€“ both at home and
                        in schools and workplaces. Recycling is crucial to the future health
                        of our planet. Here are some reasons why we should care recycling..

                        <h3>Saving energy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Making products from recycled materials requires less energy than
                            making them from new raw materials. Sometimes it's a huge difference
                            in energy.

                        <h3>Conserving natural resources</h3>
                        <p>
                            The world's natural resources are finite, and some are in very short
                            supply.

                        <h3>Protecting ecosystems and wildlife</h3>
                        <p>
                            Recycling reduces the need to grow, harvest or extract new raw
                            materials from the Earth.

                        <h3>Reducing Climate Change</h3>
                        <p>
                            Because recycling means you need to use less energy on sourcing and
                            processing new raw materials, it produces lower carbon emissions.
